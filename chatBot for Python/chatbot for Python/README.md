A Python chatbot is a computer program designed to engage in text-based conversations with users. It leverages the power of the Python programming language to understand user inputs, process information, and generate responses. These chatbots can serve various purposes, such as customer support, information retrieval, or entertainment. Python's versatility allows developers to integrate natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy to enhance their chatbots' understanding of human language.
